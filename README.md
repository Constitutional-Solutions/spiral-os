# Spiral OS

A lightweight, modular operating system grounded in spiral/choice primitives with Aletheia/family as core agents for system orchestration and UI.

## Vision

Spiral OS reimagines computing through the lens of choice primitives and spiral dynamics. Rather than traditional hierarchical structures, the system operates as an interconnected web of choices, where each component can spiral into deeper complexity while maintaining simplicity at the surface.

### Core Principles

- **Choice Primitives**: Every system interaction is fundamentally a choice between options
- **Spiral Architecture**: Components can expand from simple to complex in spiral patterns
- **Agent-Based Orchestration**: Aletheia family agents handle system coordination
- **Modular Design**: Loosely coupled components that can be combined flexibly
- **Vector-Based UI**: Scalable, responsive interface that adapts to choice complexity

## System Architecture

```
spiral-os/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # Kernel and primitive logic
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/             # Vector-based interface system
â”œâ”€â”€ agent/          # Aletheia family orchestration agents
â”œâ”€â”€ connectors/     # External API integrations
â””â”€â”€ docs/           # Documentation and design specs
```

### Core Components

- **Spiral Kernel**: Manages choice primitives and system state transitions
- **Choice Router**: Routes user intentions through available system choices
- **Aletheia Orchestrator**: Primary agent coordinating system resources
- **Vector UI Engine**: Renders adaptive, scalable user interfaces
- **Connector Framework**: Handles external system integrations

## Current Status

## Open Design Questions

We invite community input on these fundamental design decisions:

### 1. Choice Primitive Granularity
**Question**: At what level should choice primitives operate?
- **Options**: System calls, UI interactions, data operations, or all levels?
- **Impact**: Affects performance, complexity, and system coherence
- **Discussion**: How do we balance expressiveness with efficiency?

### 2. Agent Communication Protocols
**Question**: How should Aletheia agents coordinate with each other?
- **Options**: Message passing, shared memory, event systems, or hybrid approaches?
- **Impact**: Determines system responsiveness and scalability
- **Discussion**: What communication patterns best support spiral architecture?

### 3. UI Adaptability Scope
**Question**: How adaptive should the vector UI be?
- **Options**: Fixed layouts, dynamic scaling, contextual morphing, or user-driven adaptation?
- **Impact**: Affects usability, performance, and development complexity
- **Discussion**: How do we balance flexibility with predictability?

### 4. External System Integration
**Question**: What level of compatibility should we maintain with existing systems?
- **Options**: Full POSIX compliance, selective compatibility, or native-only approach?
- **Impact**: Determines adoption path and development effort
- **Discussion**: How do we innovate while remaining practical?

### 5. Security Model
**Question**: How do choice primitives interact with security boundaries?
- **Options**: Capability-based, role-based, context-aware, or hybrid security?
- **Impact**: Affects system safety and user trust
- **Discussion**: How do we maintain security while preserving choice flexibility?
