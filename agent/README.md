# Agent - Aletheia Family Orchestration

This directory contains the Aletheia family of agents responsible for system orchestration, coordination, and intelligent assistance in Spiral OS.

## Overview

The agent system replaces traditional OS daemons and services with intelligent, context-aware agents that understand user intent and coordinate system resources through choice primitives.

## Aletheia Family

**Aletheia** (Greek: ·ºàŒªŒÆŒ∏ŒµŒπŒ±, "truth" or "disclosure") is the primary orchestration agent, with specialized family members handling specific domains:

### Primary Agents

#### 1. **Aletheia Prime** - Chief Orchestrator
- **Role**: System-wide coordination and decision-making
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Route user intentions to appropriate agents
  - Resolve conflicts between agents
  - Maintain system coherence
  - Learn from user patterns
- **Status**: üöß Design phase

#### 2. **Aletheia UI** - Interface Agent
- **Role**: Manages user interface and interaction
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Translate UI events into choice primitives
  - Adapt interface based on user context
  - Coordinate with vector rendering engine
  - Provide accessibility features
- **Status**: üöß Prototype in development

#### 3. **Aletheia Resource** - Resource Manager
- **Role**: System resource allocation and optimization
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Monitor CPU, memory, disk, network usage
  - Predict resource needs
  - Optimize allocation based on priorities
  - Prevent resource starvation
- **Status**: üìù Planned

#### 4. **Aletheia Security** - Security Guardian
- **Role**: System security and privacy protection
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Enforce security policies through choice constraints
  - Monitor for security threats
  - Manage permissions and capabilities
  - Audit system actions
- **Status**: üìù Planned

#### 5. **Aletheia Network** - Network Coordinator
- **Role**: Network communication and integration
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage network connections
  - Coordinate distributed choices
  - Handle external API communications
  - Optimize network usage
- **Status**: üìù Planned

```

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate through a message-passing protocol built on choice primitives:

### Message Structure
```python
class AgentMessage:
    sender: AgentId
    recipient: AgentId
    message_type: MessageType  # REQUEST, RESPONSE, NOTIFY, etc.
    choice_context: ChoiceContext
    payload: Dict[str, Any]
    timestamp: DateTime
    correlation_id: str
```

### Communication Patterns

1. **Request-Response**: Synchronous communication for immediate needs
2. **Publish-Subscribe**: Asynchronous event broadcasting
3. **Choice Delegation**: Higher-level agent delegates choice to specialist
4. **Consensus**: Multiple agents vote on system decisions

## Agent Lifecycle

### Initialization
1. Agent registers with Aletheia Prime
2. Declares capabilities and responsibilities
3. Subscribes to relevant choice contexts
4. Loads configuration and learning models

### Operation
1. Monitor assigned domains
2. Respond to choice requests
3. Proactively optimize when possible
4. Learn from outcomes

### Coordination
1. Negotiate with other agents
2. Report status to orchestrator
3. Escalate conflicts
4. Adapt to changing conditions

## Intelligence & Learning

Agents employ multiple intelligence strategies:

### Rule-Based
- Explicit policies for common scenarios
- Fast, predictable, explainable

### Heuristic
- Pattern matching from user behavior
- Context-aware recommendations

### Machine Learning
- Supervised learning from user feedback
- Reinforcement learning for optimization
- Transfer learning between agents

### Hybrid
- Combine approaches based on confidence
- Fall back to rules when uncertain

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [x] Define agent architecture
- [ ] Implement Aletheia Prime skeleton
- [ ] Create agent communication protocol
- [ ] Build basic UI agent

### Phase 2: Integration
- [ ] Connect agents to choice primitives
- [ ] Implement resource monitoring
- [ ] Create inter-agent coordination
- [ ] Add basic learning capabilities

### Phase 3: Intelligence
- [ ] Implement user intent recognition
- [ ] Add predictive capabilities
- [ ] Build learning models
- [ ] Enable agent evolution

## Open Design Questions

### 1. Agent Autonomy Level
**Question**: How autonomous should agents be?
- **High Autonomy**: Agents make decisions independently
- **Supervised**: Agents propose, user approves
- **Collaborative**: Agents and users co-decide

**Trade-offs**: Convenience vs. control, efficiency vs. transparency

### 2. Learning Strategy
**Question**: What learning approach should agents use?
- **Centralized**: All agents share a common learning model
- **Distributed**: Each agent learns independently
- **Federated**: Local learning with shared insights

**Trade-offs**: Privacy vs. effectiveness, resources vs. capability

### 3. Failure Handling
**Question**: How should the system handle agent failures?
- **Redundancy**: Multiple agents for critical functions
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with reduced capability
- **Automatic Recovery**: Agents self-heal and restart

**Trade-offs**: Reliability vs. complexity, resources vs. resilience

### 4. Agent Specialization
**Question**: Should we favor specialist or generalist agents?
- **Specialist**: Many focused agents for specific tasks
- **Generalist**: Fewer agents with broader capabilities
- **Hybrid**: Core generalists with specialist plugins

**Trade-offs**: Efficiency vs. flexibility, simplicity vs. coverage

### 5. User Transparency
**Question**: How visible should agent operations be?
- **Transparent**: Show all agent decisions and reasoning
- **Opaque**: Hide internal workings, show only results
- **Configurable**: User chooses transparency level

**Trade-offs**: Understanding vs. distraction, trust vs. complexity

## Example: UI Agent Interaction

```python
class AletheiaUI(Agent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("aletheia_ui")
        self.ui_state = UIState()
        
    async def handle_user_input(self, event: UIEvent):
        """Convert UI event to choice primitive."""
        # Recognize user intent
        intent = await self.recognize_intent(event)
        
        # Create choice primitive
        choice = ChoicePrimitive(
            context=intent.context,
            options=await self.generate_options(intent)
        )
        
        # Send to orchestrator
        response = await self.send_to_prime(
            message_type=MessageType.REQUEST,
            payload={"choice": choice}
        )
        
        # Update UI with results
        await self.update_ui(response)
        
    async def recognize_intent(self, event: UIEvent):
        """Use ML to understand what user wants."""
        # Analyze event context
        context = self.analyze_context(event)
        
        # Match against known patterns
        patterns = self.intent_model.match(context)
        
        # Return most likely intent
        return patterns[0] if patterns else Intent.UNKNOWN
```
